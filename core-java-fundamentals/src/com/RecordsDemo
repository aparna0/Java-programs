-In the project most of time, in some of the classes we don't wright anu business code or client code, we just write variables,
 constructor, gettres and setters like POJO classes. To define such classes we can use Records.
, introduced in java 14.
-Record is one special type of class with clear syntax to define immutable data only classes.
-Compiler automatically generates constructors, getters and serilized methods such as toString(), hashCode() and equals()
-No need of setters, beacuse it contains immutable members.
-We can achive same feature using lombok, but Lombok requires annotating classes with special annotations that tell its annotation 
processor to generate the desired bytecode at compile time. It works for generation of all 
the components now supported using Java records

record Employee(String empID, String name, double salary){}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee("mangaap", "Aparna", 2000000);
        System.out.println(emp);
        System.out.println("Employee salary : " + emp.salary());
    }
}
